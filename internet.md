# How The Internet Works

This will be avery long one. I want to make it long and add a content list.
I'll put in here evrything I learn as I build `TCP` in `Rust` and read `RFC`s along the way.
My goal is to have a place where I putin everything I know about how the internet works. I'm quite fascinated about how the internet works. And I would really love to 
know deeply how things move in this convoluted nexus. `IP`, `Ethernet`, `UDP`, `HTTP`, `TLS` etc. are protocols I will talk a lot about here as I read more about them. 
I already know a substantial bit, and would love to revise those things first and validate what I know.
