# field_gleanings
learnings by topic, sometimes by language. Stored in .md format for reference purposes. Personal but may be useful to other people.
I'm writing these so I can teach and learn in the process.

The logs are unorganized yet. They're not made with blog qualtity in mind. I intend to begin transferring them to blogs as I learn more about these topics.

Areas of interest:
- Rust
- Risc-v
- Wasm
- Operating systems
