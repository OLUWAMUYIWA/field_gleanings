### Unix Commands

- `|` takes 2 commands. it starts the first program on the left and takes whatever it prints to `stdout` and sends it into `stdin` of the second command
- `>` on the other hand takes whatever the first program prints to `stdout` (e.g. `echo`) and writes it to the file on the right
